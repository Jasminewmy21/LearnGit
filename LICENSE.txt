then find the 'commit id' to version you want

GitCode is 'working directory'

.git is 'repository'

git will automatically create the first 'master' for us and there is a pointer named 'HEAD' to 'master'.

'git add' means adding file modifications to the 'stage'.
'git cmmit' means commiting all the content of 'stage' to the current branch.
Because when we created the Git repository, Git automatically created the only master branch for us, so now, git commit is to commit changes to the master branch.

git checkout -- $file : cancel the operation and back to the last 'git commit' or 'git add'

deleting files is an operation. it will be shown in 'git status'
if you really wanna delete them, you should use 'git rm $filename' and 'git commit'

'git clone' means cloning a repository from github to local repository.
